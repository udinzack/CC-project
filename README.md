This is part of the January 2020 semester cloud computing project.

Our project is to build our own API using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions.

The context of this project can be apply in our daily life application, such as:
  1. Sign-up / Sign-in user in social media.
  2. Bookmark items(s) into a cart before purchase/ make order. 
  3. and many more

index.js
- this code is written in our Lambda function.
- it serve as a medium to communicate with the API.
- in our example here, we built a simple, hard-code input to show how the flow will looks like.

API Gateway service (not included here)
 - API helps in handling protocol translations, and is especially useful when clients built with microservices make use of multiple,       disparate APIs.
